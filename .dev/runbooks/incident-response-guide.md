# Incident Response Guide

This guide outlines the process for responding to incidents in the Lumia Pro application.

## Incident Response Team

- **Incident Commander**: The person responsible for leading the incident response.
- **Communications Lead**: The person responsible for communicating with stakeholders.
- **Technical Lead**: The person responsible for the technical investigation and resolution of the incident.

## Incident Response Process

1.  **Incident Detected**: An incident is detected through monitoring, user reports, or other means.
2.  **Declare an Incident**: The person who detects the incident declares an incident and notifies the incident response team.
3.  **Assemble the Team**: The incident response team assembles and establishes a communication channel (e.g., a Slack channel).
4.  **Assess the Impact**: The team assesses the impact of the incident on users and the application.
5.  **Mitigate the Incident**: The team works to mitigate the incident and restore service as quickly as possible.
6.  **Communicate with Stakeholders**: The Communications Lead provides regular updates to stakeholders.
7.  **Resolve the Incident**: Once the incident is resolved, the team verifies that the application is functioning normally.
8.  **Post-Mortem**: The team conducts a post-mortem to understand the cause of the incident and prevent it from happening in the future.

## Communication Channels

- **Slack**: A dedicated Slack channel will be created for each incident.
- **Status Page**: A status page will be used to communicate with users.

## On-Call Rotation

An on-call rotation will be established to ensure that there is always someone available to respond to incidents.
